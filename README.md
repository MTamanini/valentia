# Valentia Case-Rap 3D Printer
![3Dview][3Dview]
Valentia is a design by David Sanz Kirbis (aka. Dasaki) based in jlguisl's foldable Case-Rap. The name "Valentia" is taken from the name (Valentia Edetanorum) the original roman founders gave, in 138 BC, to the city in Spain where I'm living now: Valencia.

From the original design only the general division / parts of the wooden structure is kept, but all measures changed and parts are custom designs to suit two of the goals: low volume and low weight.

Documentation is ongoing, but sources (Sketchup Make file and configured Marlin firmware) are pre-released on the releases section.

Current stable release is v0.5.
